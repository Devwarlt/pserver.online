    <h4>Legendary Forge</h4>

    <p>All forging is done at the Sor Forge. This can be found to the right of the spawn in the Nexus.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="/s/cr/img/valor/sor-forge.png" class="img-responsive img-outline">
    </div>

    <br>

    <p>To forge a legendary put a Legendary Sor Crystal at the top and the Shard at the bottom and click Forge.
        Depending on the Shard you use it will give you a legendary from the table of that Shard. Certain items can also
        be upgraded using a Legendary Sor Crystal such as the <strong>Warped Worlds Staff</strong>. Put the item you are
        upgrading at the
        bottom and the crystal at the top. Alternatively, at a fee of 75,000 gold, you can put a shine and a legendary
        item craftable from a shard in order to re-roll it into any other craftable legendary item from a shard.</p>

        Crystal. You can do this by going to your tabs and clicking the diamond symbol as shown below.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="/s/cr/img/valor/sor-crystal-tab.png" class="img-responsive img-outline">

    <p>The Custom Stats are as follow:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restoration (RES):</strong> restoration increases the amount of healing given when using health and
            mana potions. In addittion, having higher amounts of restoration causes you to automatically refil up to 6
            of each potion upon visiting the nexus.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Protection (PRT):</strong> protection is a Shield which will protect you from all damaging
            projectiles, It can only soak as much as what it says. So if you have 131 it will protect you from 131
            damage. This shield is not affected by defense.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Might (MGT):</strong> might is critical strike damage. You gain 0.1 bonus critical strike damage per
            7 points.

            capping at 100% critical chance at 1000 luck.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Surge (SG):</strong> surge is gained by killing enemies. You gain 2 surge per enemy that is killed
            near you. If you reach 100 surge, your protection bar is refilled. Depending on equipped items, surge can
            also have additional effects. Surge will naturally decay when enemies have not recently been killed.
        </li>

            per stat point.

            <p>Sincryer's Gate holds the first boss of the Zol Awakening Raid, <strong>Ganus the Sincryer</strong>.
                There aren't any complicated mechanics to this boss fight and it's pretty straight forward. To activate
                the boss you need to kill the 4 Stones of Zol surrounding the boss.</p>

            <hr>

            <h4>Behavior</h4>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 1</b>
                <br>
                Once the boss is activated he will go into a chase phase and shoot out 3 white shuriken shots that
                paralyze you and deal 200+ damage. Remember that you can take the first of these shots with your
                protection and not get paralyzed, but after your protection has been taken, you should focus on dodging.
                If you have a Shrine Maiden that can weaken enemies or give Armoured to everyone, you should stay in the
                group. If one is not in your group, it is recommended that you run up or down while shooting the boss to
                make sure you don't get paralyzed and sat on.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 2</b>
                <br>
                After paralyze phase the boss will run away from the player until he is stuck on a wall. He then shoots
                out a huge barrage of bullets that can insta pop a player. Since these shots do not pierce through
                players and can be tanked, it is recommended that you stay in a group in this phase if you are a squishy
                character.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 3</b>
                <br>
                After a short period of time the boss goes into phase 3. In this phase he will go invulnerable and go to
                the middle, spawning Zol Bombers all around the room. These Zol Bombers will throw out Zol Mines, which
                can be easily dodged as you can watch them throw them and make sure to stand out of the way. Be careful
                when killing Zol Bombers, because if you don't instantly kill them then they will turn red and try to
                dive on you, insta popping your character.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 4</b>
                <br>
                This phase is the worst in the fight: he starts off with a high damage barrage of bullets, similar to
                Phase 2, then becomes more passive and occasionally shoots out low damage piercing bullets. Soon after
                this he will start spawning in 2 Big Purple Slimes. It is advised NOT to kill these until after he
                activates tiles. A few seconds after the slimes spawn he will say something in caps in the chat. You
                will need to immediately get off of the dark blue tiles as they will become active and instantly kill
                your character. In this phase you want to now kill the slimes as them paralyzing you wont be a big deal
                as you are safe anyway.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 5</b>
                <br>
                After the tiles are turned off the boss will spawn little purple Zol Orbs. These will shoot out high
                damaging quiet bullets doing around 200 a hit, so you should focus these immediately. Shortly after
                that, if the boss hasn't been killed he loops back into Phase 1.
            </p>

            <h4>The Nontridus</h4>

            <p>The Nontridus is a unique part of this raid, the challenge of this area is the amount of Zol Tiles you
                have to navigate through whilst killing enemies. The Zol Aura is the main threat here, these are little
                blue tiles on the floor that when they turn green will instantly kill your character, the way to get
                through this area is to sit still before a patch of Zol Tiles, wait until they are green then back to
                blue and go in that time frame. It is normally risky to run over multiple patches of tiles at a time so
                it is not advised. This area is also home to the Zol Secret Shop a shop where you can buy legendaries
                for onrane but the shop only has a chance to spawn, when you load into The Nontridus you can see on the
                map whether you have shop map by looking at if the spawn is on the left or in the middle of the map.</p>

            <hr>

            <h4>Layout</h4>

            <p>Shop map looks like this:</p>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>If you spawn in and your map looks like this:</p>

            <br>

            <p>Then you will not have a shop spawn, your map will look like this:</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Nirux, Vision of Aldragine</strong> is a challenging fight for most groups, the Zol Auras
                combined with the 760 damage shots and Corrupted Entities usually make the fight messy and if someone
                activates the boss early the fight becomes much harder. To start the fight you have to stand in the
                inner circle of Zol Tiles in the boss room, before you do this you should always clear the purple cubes
                around the room as they can stun and mess up your damage.Once the cubes have been killed you can safely
                start the boss fight and wait for him to activate.</p>

            <hr>

            <h4>Behavior</h4>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 1</b>
                <br>
                Nirux will spawn 2 Constructs of Zol, these will shoot out 6 slow moving 760 damage boomerangs, you have
                to look out for these as they can catch you off guard if they sneak through the group. During this phase
                the boss will shoot a shotgun of 5 120 damage shots towards the closest person, as well as 3 weaken
                shots you definitely want to dodge the weaken shots so you do damage to enemies that will spawn. Upon
                killing a Construct of the Zol it will spawn either 1,3 or 4 Niolrus, you want to kite these around the
                boss otherwise they can 1 shot you with their shotgun.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 2</b>
                <br>
                After you have killed both of the Constructs of Zol the boss will transition into Phase 2, since it
                instantly transfers there will be Niolrus still alive during this phase that you should focus otherwise
                they can pick people off. The boss will switch into a short rotational phase, this is where you should
                be going in and getting your damage as the boss does not do a lot of damage in this phase, this will
                normally be the phase where the boss is killed.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 3</b>
                <br>
                If you dont kill the boss in the damage phase she will heal a bit and spawn in 4 Demons of the Dark one
                on each side of the tiles, you should focus these down then go back to damage the boss as he is now in a
                free roam phase where he surrounds himself with bullets. If you are ranged then you can still hit it but
                as a melee you should stay back.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 4</b>
                <br>
                The blue bullet cloud around him will disappear and he will shoot small amounts of rotational bullets,
                this phase is very short and not very deadly. This phase will last about 5 seconds before he loops back
                into Phase 1.

            <h4>Core of the Hideout</h4>

            <p>Core of the Hideout is a wave based boss. Each wave of enemies spawning is split into "Bursts." there are
                3 bursts in this fight, each increasing in difficulty. The challenge of this area is the small 5x5
                platform you are given to stand on. You MUST have at least 1 person on each plate or you will fail and
                the boss will kill everybody in the arena, if you see the boss flashing and saying anything in all caps,
                as well as people spamming nexus in chat or just leaving, you should nexus. To activate the boss you
                need to say "Unleash the power of the Zol!" in the chat and the 1st burst will begin shortly after.</p>

            <h4>Tips</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you spread out your players equally. Try to have a tank, healer, damage and a templar on
                    every platform. This will not happen often but at least try to make the plates even in strength so
                    nobody fails.
                </li>
                <li>Focus the Giant Cubes of Zol as they shoot a shot that stuns and will render a player useless in
                    this phase, after these the priority should be the Giant Purple Slimes as they weaken, and when they
                    split up the smaller slimes paralyze.
                </li>
                <li>The Corrupted Stone Golems do lots of damage but all of it comes from 1 shot, make sure to stay on
                    your feet moving around the platform to dodge this shot as it will confuse and speedy to try and
                    push you off of the platform. Look out for the Golem exploding into bullets when it is low, you know
                    the Golem is about to explode when he has lost his head.
                </li>
                <li>Soulbound damage comes from minions so be sure to help out.</li>
                <li>When Corrupted Stone Golems spawn with the Demons of Dark behind him in the Final Burst try have
                    someone with a piercing weapon or standing around the side of it to focus this demon down as it can
                    do lots of damage with it's shotgun and also quiet players.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Spawns listed will be total for the whole map, if it says 4 Demons of the Dark for example that means
                that 1 has spawn in every spawn location.
            </p>

            <h4>Tips</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Always look out for the grey spinning shots.
                </li>
                <li>Clear the other minions before clearing Captains of the Dark.
                </li>
                <li>When he runs to the left and shoots out his burst of 1000 damage grey shots stand a bit underneath
                    him as the shots can't hit there.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure you have people spread out before Stones of Zol spawn so you can kill them in time.</li>
                <li>Don't die or you will become a Corrupted Entity and make it harder for the group, if you aren't
                    geared enough don't risk it and make other's fail.
                </li>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>The combination of 1000 damage shots with the timed DPS phases while fallen foes become
                corrupted by the Zol makes this area the most difficult and dangerous. This boss fight requires
                communication and many players with end game gear to defeat Aldragine and banish the power of the Zol.
                This boss fight has many different phases to fight through and earns it's place as the final fight of
                the raid.</p>

            <h4>Behavior</h4>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 1</b>
                <br>
                To activate Aldragine you have to stand on him after he has turned green, when you stand on him he will
                turn red and he will be activated. Shortly after activating him he will start shooting.The first set of
                shots is 1 giant grey spinning bullet that deals 1000 damage but moves slowly along with a 4 shot 120
                damage shot gun and 8 fast moving green shots shot in every direction that deal low damage but quiet. He
                will keep shooting these out until you have done enough damage to push him to the next phase, if you
                take too long he will shoot 4 green spinning shots in each corner that deal 240 damage as well as armor
                breaking and bleeding. After you do enough damage he will run to the side and begin Phase 2.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 2</b>
                <br>
                This is a minion spawning phase, he will spawn in 4 Captains of the Dark then shortly after 4 Zol
                Sorcerers, 2 Demons of the Dark and 2 Giant cubes of zol. He will stand still at the side shooting a
                burst of 1000 damage grey bullets. To push him out of the phase you need to kill the 4 Captains of the
                Dark, he CAN move into next phase with the other minions still alive if you just kill the captains so
                it's recommended to kill them last while focusing the other minions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 3</b>
                <br>
                He then moves back to the center of the room. In this phase he shoots out 5 purple shots at the nearest
                player, dealing 120 damage each as well as shooting a faster moving green shot that quiets the player
                and a burst of black shots that slow the player. He does this for a short period before moving into
                Phase 4.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 4</b>
                <br>
                This phase is simple yet the only time you can fail this boss fight. He will spawn in 4 Stones of Zol on
                each side of the map, you have to kill these in a time frame or the boss will be too overcharged and
                leave the fight, giving you no loot or elite lootboxes. These Stones can't move but they shoot out some
                high damaging shots so be careful standing too close to them. After killing the Stones he moves into
                Phase 5.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 5</b>
                <br>
                He starts roaming a little bit around the middle, he never goes too far but be aware that he can move.
                He starts shooting out a chain of 4 green spinning shots in each corner that deal 240 damage as well as
                armor breaking and bleeding, there is no gaps in between the shots so the players are all separated into
                4 segments, during this phase he also shoots out the 1000 damage grey shots at the nearest player, he
                shoots this a lot faster than before but they can still easily be dodged. After a short amount of time
                he will move into Phase 6.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 6</b>
                <br>
                In this phase you HAVE to stand on the Zol Tile at the top or you will fail. Once you have stood on the
                tile he will start shooting low damage slow shots all around him, he will then start throwing out
                Corrupted Stone Giants. These Giants will always spawn at the top, the easy way to kill these is to
                paralyze them and have all the ranged players focus them down while a designated tank stands on the Zol
                Tile so you don't fail. He will throw out 3 Corrupted Stone Giants before going into Phase 7.

                <br>
                He will flash light blue as he goes vulnerable if you are on the tile you should run immediately as he
                will spawn in 4 Niolrus around him, these are low health and normally killed instantly but sometimes
                they will shoot. After these Niolrus have spawned he will go into a short bullet hell phase where he
                shoots out boomerangs and other shots, these only do around 120 damage and can easily be tanked as a
                melee but make sure you have a priest or some healing, this is a big damage phase for the group and can
                often be where the boss dies. After this he moves into Phase 8.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 8</b>
                <br>
                Phase 8 isn't really a big threat to players, all he does is shoot out a burst of purple shots that do
                120 and a beam of green spinner shots, these can all easily be dodged by circling the boss or having a
                designated dragger. This phase is quite short and in a short amount of time he will move to the right
                and move to Phase 9.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase 9</b>
                <br>
                This phase is identical to Phase 2 except he is on the right not the left. This is a minion spawning
                phase, he will spawn in 4 Captains of the Dark then shortly after 4 Zol Sorcerers, 2 Demons of the Dark
                and 2 Giant cubes of zol. He will stand still at the side shooting a burst of 1000 damage grey bullets.
                To push him out of the phase you need to kill the 4 Captains of the Dark, he CAN move into next phase
                with the other minions still alive if you just kill the captains so it's recommended to kill them
                lastwhile focusing the other minions.

                <br>
                This phase is identical to phase 3.He then moves back to the center of the room. In this phase he shoots
                out 5 purple shots at the nearest player, dealing 120 damage each as well as shooting a faster moving
                green shot that quiets the player and a burst of black shots that slow the player. He does this for a
                short period before moving into Phase 11.

                This phase is identical to phase 4.This phase is simple yet the only time you can fail this boss fight.
                He will spawn in 4 Stones of Zol on each side of the map, you have to kill these in a time frame or the
                boss will be too overcharged and leave the fight, giving you no loot or <strong>elite lootboxes</strong>.
                These Stones can't move but they shoot out some high damaging shots so be careful standing too close to
                them. After killing the Stones he moves into Phase 12.
            </p>

                <br>
                This phase is identical to phase 5.He starts roaming a little bit around the middle, he never goes too
                far but be aware that he can move. He starts shooting out a chain of 4 green spinning shots in each
                corner that deal 240 damage as well as armor breaking and bleeding, there is no gaps in between the
                shots so the players are all separated into 4 segments, during this phase he also shoots out the 1000
                damage grey shots at the nearest player, he shoots this a lot faster than before but they can still
                easily be dodged. After a short amount of time he will move into Phase 13.

                <br>
                This phase is a chase phase, he will follow the nearest player shooting out a wide spread cone of shots
                that inflict slow as well as a burst of black shots. It is recommend to have a tank do this phase or
                someone with a legendary that gives immunity to slow as this phase can do a lot of damage if it catches
                you off guard. After a short chase he goes into his final unique phase.

    <h4>Realm</h4>

    <p>The realm closes on a time based system rather than having to clear a certain number of events to close. Every 30
        minutes the realm will close and go to Oryx. Having this system allows players to kill more events in 1 realm so
        they can farm the custom events. All events have a chance to drop <strong>lootboxes</strong> and <strong>Sor
            Fragments</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Alerts</h4>

    <p>Alerts are a boss-only dungeon that you can obtain at a very rare chance of 1/2500 from any enemy. When you see a
        message about a challenge is awaiting you in the Nexus. You may go to the Nexus and press the button "Alerts".
        It's located at the top left of your screen, once you have clicked on it you will need to wait 15-30 seconds
        before it will teleport you to the dungeon. You must have <strong>1000 gold</strong> to open these and will lose
        10% of your gold
        if you die, but your character will not die.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>Behavior</h4>

        <p>After the boss stops talking, he will flash blue twice before shooting out shots in all directions and
            spawning in a total of 6 Frozen Souls. Then he will start chasing you while flashing blue again. Afterwards,
            he will stop flashing and run away from you while shooting bullets all around him. When he stops and flashes
            red, he will spawn multiple minions and stay invulnerable until eventually running to a corner of the
            room.</p>

        <p>At this point, he will start running around the corners of the room, shooting high damage single bullets and
            low damage rings of bullets. He will be armored when he stops at each corner, so it would be wise to stay
            safe if you are not confident you can dodge all of the shots.</p>

        <p>After he stops for a bit at the fourth corner of the room, he will flash green and run to the middle. At this
            point, you can damage him freely as he says he is recharging. When he goes invulnerable, he will spawn 4
            giant ice spheres that have armored.</p>

        <p>After you kill them, he will start shooting bullets that start at his sides and go around him until they end
            up shooting at 90 degrees compared to where they started. He will also spawn 8 Frozen Souls that should be
            taken care of before attempting to damage the boss again. On top of this, he will shoot 1 high damage shot,
            2 medium damage shots, and 3 low damage shots.</p>

        <p>Until he is killed, he will loop through theses phases.</p>

        <h4>Tips</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>If you have a weapon or ability that has 9 range or more, then you can outrange this boss and avoid the
                whole fight.
            </li>
            <li>To avoid having to deal with the bullets, it is recommended that you wait a couple seconds before going
                in, check what phase he is on, then only go in on which ever phase you feel more comfortable with
                dodging wise.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h4>Behavior</h4>

        <p>If you get close, he will take a second before shooting 10 bullets in a cone where you are and 6 shots in a
            hexagon pattern around him. He will then run away and shoot the same bullets as before, but he will also
            shoot an arrow and 8 black shuriken shots in a square around him. Soon after, he will change and shoot 4
            larger bullets in a square around him as well as 2 shurikens at a 45 degree angle based on where you are.
            Afterwards, he will become invulnerable and shoot 7 red bullets in a semi circle around him, as well as a
            flurry of black shurikens different than before.</p>

        <p>He will then switch to firing 7 white shots in a heptagon shape around him, while also firing a shotgun of 4
            brown bullets where you are. Soon after, he will start healing for 1000 HP every second and become
            vulnerable. Also at this point, he will begin firing 6 of the longer brown bullets from before in a cone, 4
            of the original black shurikens where you are, and 2 circular shots at his sides that boomerang.</p>

        <p>After you finally finish this full phase, he will become stationary and can be damaged freely. When he starts
            moving again, he move at random and shoot 6 black shurikens, 4 boomerang shots in a cone, and an arrow.
            Shortly after he will chase you while shooting more white boomerang shots. Until you make him rage, he will
            repeat all past bullet phases.</p>

        <p>His rage phase consists of him chasing you and firing the red half circle of shots and the black shurikens.
            Then he will try to get back to the middle while firing 8 white shots around him and the cone of 4 brown
            shots where you are.</p>

        <p>If you don't kill him by this point, he will loop starting at when he heals for 1000 HP every second. This
            will keep happening until he is defeated.</p>

        <h4>Tip</h4>

        <p>Always check how much air you have so you dont suffocate.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>Behavior</h4>

        <p>When the boss has started he will start to shoot small low damage bullets randomly in front of him, these are
            of little threat to a geared character. While these shots are still being shot out the tentacles start to
            shoot out paralyze projectiles, these must be avoided as soon after this the tentacles will shoot out 4x200
            damage bombs and you wont be able to dodge them, if you got paralyzed you will be hit by 2 bursts of these
            and most likely die. At the point of the second set of bombs being thrown the boss will probably have sunk
            back underwater. When he does this you need to go to the other side of the map to fight it again with the
            same pattern, you need to do this for all 4 sides.</p>

        <p>After you have killed the boss on all 4 sides he will appear in the middle in a pool of water, he will spawn
            in kraken tentacles that you have to kill to be able to hit the boss. During this phase he will also throw
            out Giant Squids from the Ocean Trench, you should focus these as they will cover the the map with ink if
            they are left alone. After all the tentacles have been killed the boss will go vulnerable and armor broken,
            this will normally be where you kill the boss.</p>

        <p>Look out for any bombs as they do big damage and confuse.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>Behavior</h4>

        <p>The boss will start with a chase phase, he will shoot out 8 swords in front of him as well as blue shots that
            stun in a burst all around him, this phase is very easy if you just circle him around the room. As the phase
            goes on for longer he loses the blue shot burst and the 8 swords become 4 swords. After that phase he will
            gain a new cone attack in front of him, this time with blue balls that paralyze the player, he does not
            perfectly follow you in this phase and free roams around with an occasional dash.</p>

        <p>After this he will change to shooting 3 blue shots in front of him, these are slow moving so you will never
            get hit by them if you circle, while he's doing this he also shoots out blue wave shots that do not apply a
            status effect. After this he runs back to the middle for a damage phase followed by a stationary turret
            phase where he targets the player and shoots directly at him. He stays in this stationary turret phase until
            he starts healing then he goes back into a rage chase phase where he shoots out paralyze shots and tries to
            sit on you.</p>
